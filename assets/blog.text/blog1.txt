Title: Career Change: The Path towards Programming

I never thought I would work as a programmer. In the past, my dream was always to become a detective and follow the trail of truth. Unfortunately, I realized that this profession doesn't receive the deserved appreciation and recognition.

Five years ago, I started working as a manual game tester for a company, and finally, I could work with my favorite game every day. I began to delve into the world of development and was simply captivated by all the background work behind it. Then, I started researching and delving deeper into the subject, and it completely enchanted me.

In this blog post, I want to share my career change journey and how I got involved in programming. As I learned and practiced more, I realized that programming is a field that offers opportunities for creativity, problem-solving, and continuous growth.

The first step was to familiarize myself with various programming languages and technologies. I started taking online courses, reading books, and working on my projects. I experienced how exciting and challenging tasks I could encounter in my daily life and how fulfilling it is to find solutions for them.

Everyone has their own path to a career change, but based on my experience, I would advise taking risks and stepping into the unknown. Dedicate time and energy to learning and practicing, and don't hesitate to ask questions and seek help from the community.

Five years ago, my journey as a programmer began, and since then, I can't get enough of this field. The constant growth, new challenges, and the opportunity for creation are truly mesmerizing. And the best part is that it's never too late to start, regardless of age or life situation.
