      <h2>Title: Career Change: The Path towards Programming</h2>

        <h3>introduction</h3>
        <p>
          I never thought I would work as a programmer. In the past, my dream
          was always to become a detective and follow the trail of truth.
          Unfortunately, I realized that this profession doesn't receive the
          deserved appreciation and recognition.

          Five years ago, I started working as a manual game tester for a
          company, and finally, I could work with my favorite game every day. I
          began to delve into the world of development and was simply captivated
          by all the background work behind it. Then, I started researching and
          delving deeper into the subject, and it completely enchanted me. In
          this blog post, I want to share my career change journey and how I got
          involved in programming. As I learned and practiced more, I realized
          that programming is a field that offers opportunities for creativity,
          problem-solving, and continuous growth. The first step was to
          familiarize myself with various programming languages and
          technologies. I started taking online courses, reading books, and
          working on my projects. I experienced how exciting and challenging
          tasks I could encounter in my daily life and how fulfilling it is to
          find solutions for them. Everyone has their own path to a career
          change, but based on my experience, I would advise taking risks and
          stepping into the unknown. Dedicate time and energy to learning and
          practicing, and don't hesitate to ask questions and seek help from the
          community.

        <h3>conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Five years ago, my journey as a programmer began, and since then, I
          can't get enough of this field. The constant growth, new challenges,
          and the opportunity for creation are truly mesmerizing. And the best
          part is that it's never too late to start, regardless of age or life
          situation.
